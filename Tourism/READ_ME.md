# International Tourist Arrivals Analysis Project

Discover the world through data with the International Tourist Arrivals Analysis. This project delves into a comprehensive exploration of international tourist arrivals from 1995 to 2021. Using Python and data analysis libraries, this project uncovers intriguing insights and trends in international tourism.

## Key Highlights:

1. **Data Analysis:** The project begins by importing and cleaning a dataset containing international tourist arrivals data. Columns such as 'Code' are removed to focus on essential information.

2. **Exploratory Analysis:** You'll find an initial exploration of the dataset, such as unique regions and year ranges, which sets the stage for deeper insights.

3. **Significant Figures:** A summary of average tourist arrivals per entity reveals the leading regions in international tourism, with Europe standing out as the top destination.

4. **Visualizations:** Various visualizations add depth to the analysis. A pie chart illustrates the average international tourist arrivals by origin, and interactive graphs showcase year-over-year percentage changes, allowing you to see how travel trends have evolved over time.Also, interactive animations display the total international tourist arrivals for different regions over the years, helping you visualize trends in international tourism.

5. **Time Series Analysis:** Dive into linear regression, Ridge regression, and Lasso regression models to predict tourist arrivals for the future. The project offers predictions up to 2035 based on historical data and highlights the strengths and weaknesses of different regression techniques.

6. **Metrics:** To evaluate the prediction models, key metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R2) are provided, demonstrating the accuracy and performance of each model.

This project is a perfect example of how data analysis and visualization can reveal insights and predict future trends. Explore the fascinating world of international tourism through data.
