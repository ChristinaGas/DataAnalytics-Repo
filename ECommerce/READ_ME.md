# Predictive Analysis of E-commerce Customer Behavior Project

ðŸš€ **Overview:**

Welcome to my E-commerce Customer Behavior Analysis project! This data-driven project dives into understanding and predicting customer behavior for an e-commerce company. Utilizing Python and powerful data science libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn, I performed an exploratory data analysis and developed a predictive model.

ðŸ“Š **Key Findings:**

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis:** I started by exploring the dataset, visualizing the relationships between different factors. Notable insights include the positive correlation between 'Length of Membership' and 'Yearly Amount Spent,' and the negative correlation between 'Time on Website' and 'Yearly Amount Spent.'

2. **Data Preprocessing:** To prepare the data for modeling, I scaled the features using Min-Max scaling and split it into training and testing sets.

3. **Linear Regression Model:** The predictive model was built using a Linear Regression algorithm. The model was trained on the training data, and its coefficients were examined. The predictions were evaluated using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

4. **Visualizations:** I created captivating visualizations using seaborn, helping to illustrate relationships within the data. These visualizations provide a clear picture of customer behavior and key correlations.

ðŸŽ¯ **Results**

This project not only gained valuable insights into customer behavior for the e-commerce company but also established a predictive model to estimate the yearly amount spent by a customer based on various features. Understanding these patterns can assist the company in tailoring strategies to increase customer engagement and sales, especially through the mobile app.
